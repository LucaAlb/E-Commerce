Analysis of an E-Commerce Platform

**INTRODUCTION**

The project involved a team of 4 individuals who will now present the analysis conducted on the dataset related to an **E-commerce**,
the data was originally sourced from a dataset available on **bigQuery**,
and as we will see later, we decided to establish connections among different datasets, managing to capture three types of analysis,
one related to the **warehouse**
(by combining datasets of distribution centers, inventories, and products),
one related to **marketing** (by combining users and events), and one related to **sales** (by combining users, products, and the two datasets concerning orders)
We extracted the datasets using **SQL** language through Colab and then transferred them to **Visual Studio Code** for data cleaning.
Finally, we enabled the analysis through the **TABLEAU** visualization tool
in order to explore this reality to the fullest and provide you with a comprehensive overview.

**WEBSITE**

To allow a potential user or a professional to freely choose the department of their interest or simply to interact with our analyses, we created the E-Commerce website using Visual Studio Code and the Flask framework.
As you can see on this website, we decided to create a division that enables the selection of the three departments to view: warehouse, marketing, and sales, and it provides the opportunity to freely query each of them.
